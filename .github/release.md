## Changes

---

Each archive contains the plugin and Lua DLLs, along with an example Lua script
that you can use as a starting point. The `x64` and `x86` variants are for 64
and 32-bit games, respectively. For each variant, both `zip` and `tar.gz`
formats contain the same files.

See the [README](./README.md) for more information.
