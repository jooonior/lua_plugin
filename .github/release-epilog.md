Each archive contains the plugin and Lua binaries, along with an example Lua script that you can use as a starting point. The `64` and `32` variants are for 64 and 32-bit games, respectively. For each variant, both `zip` and `tar.gz` formats contain the same files.

See the [README](./README.md) for more information.
